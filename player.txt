Note: Anoxle Player requires Font Awesome for icons. The default configuration will load Font Awesome from CDN, but you can specify your own URL if needed.

Basic Usage
1. Create a container element in your HTML:
<div id="videoPlayerContainer"></div>

2. Initialize the player with configuration options:
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  AnoxlePlayer.init({
    container: 'videoPlayerContainer',
    sources: {
      '1080p': 'https://example.com/video/1080p.webm',
      '720p': 'https://example.com/video/720p.webm',
      '480p': 'https://example.com/video/480p.webm'
    },
    defaultQuality: '720p',
    autoplay: false,
    muted: false
  });
});

      AnoxlePlayer.init({
        container: 'videoPlayerContainer',
        sources: {
          '1080p': 'https://example.com/video/1080p.webm',
          '720p': 'https://example.com/video/720p.webm',

          '360p': 'https://example.com/video/360p.webm'
        },
        defaultQuality: '720p'
      });
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>

Auto-Quality Selection Example
The player can automatically select the best quality based on network conditions:

// The quality will be chosen automatically
document.querySelector('.anoxle-quality-auto').click();

The auto-quality feature uses navigator.connection to detect network speed and selects the appropriate quality:
- < 1 Mbps: Lowest quality
- 1-2 Mbps: Second lowest quality
- 2-5 Mbps: Medium quality
- 5-10 Mbps: High quality
- > 10 Mbps: Highest quality

Browser Compatibility
Anoxle Player is compatible with all modern browsers:
- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 60+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+
- Opera 47+

Note on WebM Support: The example uses WebM video format. For broader compatibility, consider providing fallback formats like MP4 in your implementation.

Troubleshooting

Common Issues

Video Not Loading
If the video fails to load, check the following:
- Ensure your video URLs are correct and accessible
- Verify that the video format is supported by the browser
- Check browser console for specific error messages

Controls Not Appearing

- Make sure Font Awesome is loading correctly
- Check for CSS conflicts that might be hiding the controls
